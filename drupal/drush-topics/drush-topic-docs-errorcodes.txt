==== Drush Error Codes ====

Drush error codes are alphanumeric constants that represent an unrecoverable error condition that may arise during the execution of some command.  They are set by the following function:

  return drush_set_error('DRUSH_ERROR_CODE', dt('Error message.'));

In general, any drush command that calls drush_set_error is expected to also return FALSE as its function result.  The drush_set_error function returns FALSE to make it easy to exit with an error code.  Error codes are returned as part of the drush backend invoke process, which is used by drush API functions such as drush_invoke_process.  An example of how to test for a specific error code is shown below:

  $result = drush_invoke_process('@self', 'some-command');
  if (array_key_exists('DRUSH_ERROR_CODE', $result['error_log'])) {
    // handle ocurrances of DRUSH_ERROR_CODE here
  }

Some of the available drush error codes are listed in the table below.
