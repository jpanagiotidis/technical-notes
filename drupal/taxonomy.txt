## Get vocabulary metadata from machine name
	taxonomy_vocabulary_machine_name_load('machine_name');

## Get vocabulary tree
	taxonomy_get_tree($vid, $parent = 0, $max_depth = NULL, $load_entities = FALSE);

	PARAMETERS
	$vid: Which vocabulary to generate the tree for.

	$parent: The term ID under which to generate the tree. If 0, generate the tree for the entire vocabulary.

	$max_depth: The number of levels of the tree to return. Leave NULL to return all levels.

	$load_entities: If TRUE, a full entity load will occur on the term objects. Otherwise they are partial objects queried directly from the {taxonomy_term_data} table to save execution time and memory consumption when listing large numbers of terms. Defaults to FALSE.
