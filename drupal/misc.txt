## Get summary
  text_summary($text, $format = NULL, $size = NULL)

  ## Description
    Generate a trimmed, formatted version of a text field value.

    If the end of the summary is not indicated using the <!--break--> delimiter then we generate the summary automatically, trying to end it at a sensible place such as the end of a paragraph, a line break, or the end of a sentence (in that order of preference).

  ## Parameters
    $text: The content for which a summary will be generated.

    $format: The format of the content. If the PHP filter is present and $text contains PHP code, we do not split it up to prevent parse errors. If the line break filter is present then we treat newlines embedded in $text as line breaks. If the htmlcorrector filter is present, it will be run on the generated summary (if different from the incoming $text).

    $size: The desired character length of the summary. If omitted, the default value will be used. Ignored if the special delimiter is present in $text.
