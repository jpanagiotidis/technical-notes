## Boost Installation
	1) install boost module
	2) go to admin/config/system/boost and set:
		html maximum lifetime > 1 week
		html minimum lifetime = 0
	3) go to /admin/config/development/performance
		and disable page caching for anonymous users
	4) the default settings on /admin/config/system/boost/htaccess should be ok, but if boost isn't working try %{SERVER_NAME} instead of %{HTTP_HOST}
	5) go to /admin/config/system/boost/htaccess/generator and copy-paste the generated rules into .htaccess file (as described on the bottom of the page). Alternatively use the htacces module (see below)
	6) go to /admin/reports/status and check if the boost cache directory is writable by the server, if not change the directory permissions
		cd path/to/drupal/root
		chmod 0775 cache -R
	7) check if boost is working

## Cache expiration integration
	1) install expire module
