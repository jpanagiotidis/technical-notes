## Touch
	## Description
		Structure describing the status of a finger touching the screen.

		Devices can track a number of different pieces of data about a touch on a touchscreen, including its phase (ie, whether it has just started, ended or moved), its position and whether the touch was a single contact or several taps. Furthermore, the continuity of a touch between frame updates can be detected by the device, so a consistent ID number can be reported across frames and used to determine how a particular finger is moving.

		The Touch struct is used by Unity to store data relating to a single touch instance and is returned by the Input.GetTouch function. Fresh calls to GetTouch will be required on each frame update to obtain the latest touch information from the device but the fingerID property can be used to identify the same touch between frames.
