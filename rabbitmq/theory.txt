## Mantra
  You cant sent a message directly to a queue. 
  You send the message to an exchange and the exchange delivers the message to the queue.

## Message Durability (survive across rabbitmq server restarts)
  1) Message should be durable (delivery mode = 2)
  2) Passing Exchanges should be durable (durable = true)
  3) Arriving Queue should be durable (durable = true)

  *This option is 10x slower, so in cases where perfomance AND durability are crucial implement custom solution.
