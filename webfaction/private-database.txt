## MySQL
  ## Description
    MySQL instance

    This creates a private MySQL instance, running as your user on a random port, that you 
    can use to serve and manage your MySQL databases, instead of using the
    WebFaction control panel and shared MySQL database service.

    On Centos-5 servers the instance runs MySql-5.0 and on Centos-6 servers the instance runs MySql-5.5.

    A private MySQL instance uses between a few tens of megabytes of memory and hundreds of megabytes of memory depending on how much data it's managing.

    This app also sets up a cronjob to make a dump of all databases every 24h. The dumps are in the directory:
    ~/webapps/<app_name>/dumps/
    The app creates a third cronjob that deletes all dumps older than 7 days.
    Note that if you change the MySql root password you will need to update the password in ~/webapps/<app_name>/.my.cnf otherwise the dumps will stop working.

  ## Start the instance
    ~/webapps/<app_name>/bin/start

  ## Stop the instance
    ~/webapps/<app_name>/bin/stop

  ## Restart the instance
    ~/webapps/<app_name>/bin/stop && ~/webapps/<app_name>/bin/start

  ## Connect to instance
    mysql -S ~/webapps/<app_name>/var/mysql.sock -u root -p
    or
    mysql -P <app_port> -u root -p --protocol=tcp

  ## Config file location
    ~/webapps/<app_name>/etc/my.cnf

  ## Error log location
    ~/logs/user/error_<app_name>.log

  ## Automatic dumps location
    ~/webapps/<app_name>/dumps/

  ## Creating Private MySQL Databases and Users
    1) connect via ssh to the server
    2) connect to the instance (see "Connect to instance" above)
    3) CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;
    4) CREATE USER '<username>' IDENTIFIED BY '<pass>';
    5) USE <database_name>;
    6) GRANT ALL ON <database_name>.* TO '<username>';

  ## Import database
    mysql -P <port> --protocol=tcp -u root -p -D <database_name> < <dump_file>

  ## Connect with application
